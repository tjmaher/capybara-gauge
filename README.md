# capybara-gauge
This project is a basic UI testing framework with Capybara + Ruby + Bundler + Gauge testing Dave Haeffner's site, [The-Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login). 

Normally, [logs](https://github.com/tjmaher/capybara-gauge/tree/master/logs) and [reports](https://github.com/tjmaher/capybara-gauge/tree/master/reports) are set not to upload in the .gitignore. We have uploaded both for the reader to view.
