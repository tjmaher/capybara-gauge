# capybara-gauge
This project is a basic UI testing framework with Capybara + Ruby + Bundler + Gauge testing Dave Haeffner's site, [The-Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login). 

Normally, [logs](https://github.com/tjmaher/capybara-gauge/tree/master/logs) and [reports](https://github.com/tjmaher/capybara-gauge/tree/master/reports) are set not to upload in the .gitignore. We have uploaded both for the reader to view. 

Example: The reader can view the HTML Reports: (http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/tjmaher/capybara-gauge/blob/master/reports/html-report/index.html) generated.
